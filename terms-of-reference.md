* The AC will work transparently..  
* We work in the open. We will publish papers considered at meetings along with meeting recordings and minutes subject to 1.10. This will include on the Github solid/odi-governance repository. 

### 1.10 Confidentiality  
   
The importance of matters discussed at the AC requires a high level of transparency, and so the assumption is that all matters discussed in AC meetings \- and between AC members should happen, where possible on open channels. 

However, there are times when a confidential discussion is required, the AC will convene a closed session, and emails discussing the matter should be appropriately marked. Records kept in the same way as for other sessions, but not released. If confidential sessions are held, the existence of the sessions should be made public and, if appropriate, the broad topic discussed.

### 1.11 Review of the Advisory Committee

Though membership may vary, the AC will exist in this format. Should there be a requirement to amend the structure this will take place through an open consultation process with the AC as part of the annual review period.  This review will take place no earlier than May 2026\. 

There may be a requirement to review membership prior to May 2026 to ensure access to the relevant skills and network to progress the project for a particular Use Case in line with 2.7. However, this will be done in consultation with the AC. 

### 1.12 Advice and wider structures  
   
The AC should actively maintain a network of expert and trusted advisors from a range of related sectors and organisations who are able to provide input on specific matters, and who have a standing invitation to raise matters with the AC for consideration. The AC should proactively share summary notes from AC meetings with this network.  
   
The AC should willingly receive input and representations from members of the wider Solid community who wish to express a view, raise a concern or make a suggestion about how Solid could work. Anyone who would like to raise an item can do so by contacting the chair.   
   
The AC will give consideration at each meeting to any advice received, whether solicited or not, and decide on a response.

This group is a strategic group.  Technical or operational matters are dealt with in the other technical groups and forums.   
   
### 1.13 Interactions with other Solid forums

The AC has a formal role to review and respond to monthly reports from:

* The Operations Advisory Committee (OAC) and other stood up advisory groups  
* The Linked Web Storage Working Group (W3C WG)  
* The Practitioners Group (PG)  
* The Solid Community Group (W3C WG)
