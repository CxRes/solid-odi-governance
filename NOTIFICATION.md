Dear Solid Community,

The Open Data Institute has drafted a Governance Structure to guide our work on stewarding the Solid Community.

We welcome any feedback you may have on this proposal.

The proposed governance structure, and instructions for providing feedback can be found at https://github.com/solid/odi-governance.

Best,
Jesse
